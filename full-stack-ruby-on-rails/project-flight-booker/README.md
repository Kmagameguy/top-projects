# The Odin Project - Mock Flight Ticket Booking

## Introduction
This is a mock flight ticket booking application built with Ruby on Rails. It is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/ruby-on-rails-flight-booker).  The data is mocked and not connected to any real flight data.  The purpose of this project is to practice building nested forms and working with databases.

## Set Up

1. Clone this repo
1. Run `bundle install`
1. Run `rails db:migrate`
1. Run `rails db:seed` to get some fake data to work with
1. Run `rails server` to start the server
1. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in your browser to see the application

## Notes
By default flights only depart from 'ATL'.  See seeds.rb for more information
regarding the built-in flight and airport data.
